# Babylonian Archives of the Veiled Choir

> There are certain beings, woven from the threads of light and shadow, whose names echo through the oldest corners of our history.
>
> This library belongs to the angels known as The Veiled Choir.
> They are not the gentle protectors we imagine, but watches, keepers of secrets beyond human understanding.
> To know their names is to glimpse a deeper truth: each angel represents a forgotten covenant, an ancient balance that safeguards > our world.
